                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Driven and creative, a strong sense of visual design, and practical skils in UI/UX, prototyping,
                    and creative problem-solving. Comfortable with tools like Figma, VSCode, and GitHub, I translate 
                    ideas into clean, user-friendly designs. I thrive in fast-paced collaborative environments where
                    precision and creativity drive results.

                    <p>
                        I support students with diverse learning needs by implementing individualized education plans (IEPs),
                        providing academic and behavioral support, and fostering an inclusive, nurturing environment. I collaborate
                        closely with teachers, therapists, and families to ensure students' educational and emotional success. 
                        Notably, I led the creation of a sensory room to support self-regulation and sensory integration, offering
                        students a safe and calming space. I also organized and facilitated a city-wide field day, promoting social
                        engagement, physical acitivity, and commubnity building among students of all abilities.
